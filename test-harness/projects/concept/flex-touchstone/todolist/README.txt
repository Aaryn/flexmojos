NOTE: settings.xml is can be located at:
  1. User Level. This settings.xml file provides configuration for a single user, 
                 and is normally provided in $HOME/.m2/settings.xml.
  2. Global Level. This settings.xml file provides configuration for all maven
                 users on a machine (assuming they're all using the same maven
                 installation). It's normally provided in 
                 ${maven.home}/conf/settings.xml.
